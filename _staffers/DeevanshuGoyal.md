Hi all! My name is Deevanshu Goyal and I am a second-year masters student in the Machine Learning and Data Science track of the ECE department. I am originally from India and I moved to San Diego in 2022. In my free time, I like to learn new recipes, watch new movies/animes and read about genetics. Do you have the Hitchhiker's Thumb? Check it out if you haven't already. Looking forward to meeting you all for DSC 106, it will be a fun quarter!
